# Cemuhook-GLCache-SaveLoad
Batch scripts to automate the saving and loading of GLCaches

# How to install
If you would like the automatic loading cache, download the .cmd file inside of GLCache_singlebatch, and place inside of your Cemu folder with the Cemu.exe inside. 

If you would like to load and save the cache yourself, download the .bat files inside of GLCache_SaveLoad and place inside of your Cemu folder with Cemu.exe.


# How to use
For the singlebatch, just run the .cmd file and wait, it will automatically load Cemu like normal for you. Once Cemu is closed, it will automatically save your GLCache for you. 

For the SaveLoad, you will have to use the loading batch file before you start Cemu, and the saving batch file when you exit Cemu.
